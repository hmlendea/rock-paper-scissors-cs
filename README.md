# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This was my first C# application back in 2011.
I made this when I was learning C#, while transitioning from VB.

The VB version of this application can be found here: [hmlendea/rock-paper-scissors-vb](https://github.com/hmlendea/rock-paper-scissors-vb)

## Status

I just uploaded the files as I found them collecting dust and using up my storage space.

I don't know if the project builds or not.
